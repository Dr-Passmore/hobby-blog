## Introduction

The build process for this project is straight forward and I would suggest the bird feeder camera as a good beginner project, particularly if you are interested in Raspberry Pi Cameras. The bird feeder used is a simple [Acrylic Hanging Bird Feeder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Acrylic-Hanging-Suction-Decorate-15x15x7cm/dp/B08XMNMQTY/ref=sr_1_2?crid=27VH3MXIPUFTJ&keywords=Window+Bird+Feeder+Clear+Acrylic+Hanging+Bird+Feeder+with+3+Strong+Extra+Suction+Cups+and+Seed+Tray+for+Small+Birds+Decorate+Your+House+%2815x15x7cm%29&qid=1689535986&s=outdoors&sprefix=window+bird+feeder+clear+acrylic+hanging+bird+feeder+with+3+strong+extra+suction+cups+and+seed+tray+for+small+birds+decorate+your+house+15x15x7cm+%2Coutdoor%2C76&sr=1-2) which attaches to a window using suction cups.

## Overview of the Raspberry Pi Camera Setup

The project makes use of Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera Module. The camera module uses the 12.3 megapixel Sony IMX477 sensor and has a range of lens supporting M12 mounted lens or C/CS mounted lens. The High Quality Camera Module is avalible with a M12 lens version, but I recommend making use of the standard High Quality Camera Module and purchasing a M12 lens with an adaptor.

The project requires the following parts:
