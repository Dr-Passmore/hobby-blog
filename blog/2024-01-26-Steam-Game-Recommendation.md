## Overview

## Challenges

Creating a recommendation system has several challenges. All data is being brought in using the Steam API. Initially, I planned to build a recommender which included Steam Store user tags. However, this information is not accessible through the API. When I hit the first challenge, I considered using game genres as part of the recommendation system.   

### Ambigious genres

Unlike music, movies and books, video games have terrible genre labels. While all mediums has media that lacks clear genres, video games, in particular, present unique challenges due to the lack of standardised genre labelling. This ambiguity in genre classification can hinder the effectiveness of a recommendation system. 

For example: 

#### Alien Vs Preditor

You also have games that blend genres. During this project I noticed I owned the Alien Vs Preditor[AVP] game which actually highlights the challenge. AVP has three campaigns:

1. Alien Campaign - Action/Puzzle - Normally break certain things and learn the map to identify routes that bypass turrets etc
2. Marine Campaign - Action/Horror - Complete objectives and avoid being killed by waves of aliens. Instant death by face hugger jump scare. 
3. Preditor Campaign - Action/Shooter - Shoot your way through the campaign. 

All three have very different experiences  


### Bias

## Building the recommendation system

### System 1: Completed Games

### System 2: Most played games

### System 3: Random Selection of unplayed
