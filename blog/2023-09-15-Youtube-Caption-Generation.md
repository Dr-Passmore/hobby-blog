Accessibility in the digital age is crucial to consider. This Subtitle Generation project merges the power of code with the necessity of inclusivity on one of the internet's most popular platforms: YouTube. This blog will document the process for developing an automatic subtitle creation program using Python, designed to make online content more accessible to a broader audience.

Initially, I undertook a small project to help my partner create subtitles for her YouTube videos. The automatically generated subtitles were of poor quality, and while YouTube allows you to edit their subtitles, this is a time-consuming process. Instead, this approach provided easily editable text files, and I was able to generate subtitle files from a CSV listing all her video URLs. For example, the video ['DIY Beach Towel Poncho Tutorial'](https://youtu.be/sxDlKdQk1Ww?si=VpWvCg5-Fo00Tjul) now boasts improved subtitles. This approach also benefits auto-translation, ensuring coherent subtitles for international audiences.

In this blog, I will explore how to harness the power of Python to create a program that generates subtitles for YouTube videos automatically. We will break down these steps, discuss the underlying technologies, and provide you with the knowledge and tools to embark on your own accessibility-enhancing coding adventure. Whether you're a seasoned Python developer or a newcomer eager to learn, this blog has something for you.
