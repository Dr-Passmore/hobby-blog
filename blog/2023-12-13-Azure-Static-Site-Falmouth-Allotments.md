I took over managing the [Falmouth Allotments website](https://falmouthallotments.org/) and needed to migrate the website from a previous hosting solution. I initially deployed the WordPress site to a `Standard B1s` virtual machine. However, a recent update ended up breaking the WordPress site and initial attempts to fix failed.

What was looking like a headache to troubleshoot and resolve, this actually turned out to be an opportunity to redesign the site. When I took over managing the site, I had discussions with the allotment committee about the website needing a redesign with some initial ideas being discussed. Fortunately, the website going down was an impertus to begin this project.

Moving away from an old Wordpress website with a focus on performance, cost reduction, and accessibility is an exciting project to undertake.

## Overview

The main goals I have for the new site are:

- Implement a modern clean design.
- Reduce the quantity and size of images displayed.
- The website has been designed with accessiblity in mind.
- Replace all documents with either webforms or easily browserable pages (Rules and Constituation).
- Significantly reduce hosting costs.

To measure these goals I will be making Use of [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/#devtools) to generate page reports. This enables me to find not only identify performance impacts, but also any accessibility issues. In addition, I want to limit the environmental impact of the website. Fortunately, this can be measured using the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com) and essentially, carbon cost is limited by making sure the new website is efficiently designed.

## Azure

For hosting the website I'm going to be deploying to Azure. I have already moved the old site to Azure using a `Standard B1s` virtual machine to host the old WordPress website. I have also seen this as an opportunity to practice [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Terraform is Infrastructure By Code and is a great way to manage cloud infrastructure. Primarily, Terraform helps standardise and inherently documents the infrastructure set up. I admit from a time perspective it is very inefficient for a small project like this one, as I could have created everything in the portal in a fraction of the time required to get this set up.

### Terraform Deployment

The terraform deployment requires a Azure service principal to be created in Azure Entra with contribution access to the subscription. Using a gitaction workflow I'm able to manage deployment of infrastructure by code.   

The gitaction workflow is designed to automate the deployment of Terraform configurations on Azure when changes are pushed to the specified branch (in this case, the master branch). I will break down the key components of the workflow:

```yml
name: Deploy Terraform

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
```

name: Specifies the name of the GitHub Actions workflow, in this case, "Deploy Terraform."

on: Defines the trigger for the workflow. In this example, the workflow is triggered on each push to the master branch.

```yml
jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

jobs: Describes the set of tasks to be executed as part of the workflow.

terraform: The name of the job, representing the Terraform deployment.

runs-on: Specifies the type of runner for the job. In this case, it runs on an Ubuntu environment.

```yml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

steps: Defines a series of steps to be executed within the job.

Checkout code: Uses the GitHub Actions built-in action to checkout the source code repository at the latest commit.

```yml
  - name: Set up Terraform
    uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
    with:
      terraform_version: 1.6.3
```
Set up Terraform: Utilises the HashiCorp setup-terraform action to install and set up the specified version of Terraform.

```yml
  - name: Configure Azure CLI
    run: |
      az login --service-principal -u ${{ secrets.ARM_CLIENT_ID }} -p ${{ secrets.ARM_CLIENT_SECRET }} --tenant ${{ secrets.ARM_TENANT_ID }}
      az account set --subscription ${{ secrets.ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}

```    

Configure Azure CLI: Configures the Azure CLI with the necessary credentials using Azure service principal details stored as GitHub secrets.

```yml
  - name: List Azure Resources
    run: |
      az resource list --output table
```
List Azure Resources: Uses the Azure CLI to list resources in the specified Azure subscription. 

```yml
  - name: Initialize and Set up Terraform Backend
    run: |
      terraform init -force-copy
```
Initialize and Set up Terraform Backend: Initialises the Terraform configuration and sets up the Terraform backend.

```yml
  - name: Apply Terraform
    run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```
Apply Terraform: Executes the Terraform apply command with auto-approval to deploy the infrastructure specified in the Terraform configuration.

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of deploying Terraform configurations on Azure, providing a streamlined and version-controlled approach to infrastructure management.

#### Provider and Backend Terraform

```terraform
provider "azurerm" {
    features {}
}
```

In this section, the Terraform provider for Microsoft Azure, "azurerm," is declared. The features {} block is left empty, indicating the default configuration.

```terraform
# Back end storage of the terraform state file
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = "tf-state-rg"
    storage_account_name   = "{UniqueStorageAccount}"
    container_name         = "tfstate"
    key                    = "terraform.tfstate"
    sas_token = ""
  }
}
```

In this section, the backend configuration for storing the Terraform state file is specified. The state file contains information about the infrastructure managed by Terraform. The backend is set to Azure Storage ("azurerm"). The configuration includes the following parameters:

- **resource_group_name:** The name of the Azure Resource Group where the storage account for storing the Terraform state will reside. It is set to "tf-state-rg."

- **storage_account_name:** This should be replaced with a unique name for the Azure Storage Account where the Terraform state file will be stored. It is recommended to replace `{UniqueStorageAccount}` with an actual, unique name.

- **container_name:** The name of the container within the storage account. In this case, it is set to "tfstate."

- **key:** The name of the Terraform state file, which is set to "terraform.tfstate."

- **sas_token:** Shared Access Signature (SAS) token, which is currently left empty. If needed, a SAS token can be provided for secure access to the storage account.

It's important to replace `{UniqueStorageAccount}` with a globally unique name for the storage account to avoid naming conflicts. Additionally, appropriate authentication and access controls should be configured for the storage account to ensure secure management of the Terraform state.

#### Creating a Resource Group

Now I need to create a Resource Group for the Falmouth Allotment website. The following section of code creates the resource group with the name `falmouth-allotment-website`:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "falmouth_allotments_website" {
  name     = "falmouth-allotment-website"
  location = "west europe"
  
  tags = {
    environment          = "production"
    Falmouth_Allotments  = "website"
  }
}
```

The name attribute sets the name of the Azure Resource Group to "falmouth-allotment-website," and location determines its Azure region, here specified as "west europe."

The location is set to 'west europe' as we are limited on locations for Azure Static Web Apps. Otherwise I would deploy to UK South.

Tags, like "environment" and "Falmouth_Allotments," provide metadata for better organisationâ€”indicating a production environment and association with the Falmouth Allotments website.

#### Creating a Storage Account

One of the key limits of the free Azure Static Web Apps is the size limitation of `0.25 GB`. Considering the main cause of data usage on website is images, we can use a blob storage container to store images and and in this case files needed for the website (rules, new member forms, etc). Therefore, we are going to create a storage account and blob storage container:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "webstorageaccount" {
  name                     = "falmouthallotmentsweb"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.falmouth_allotments_website.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.falmouth_allotments_website.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"
  tags = {
    environment = "production"
    Falmouth-Allotments = "website"
  }
}

# Container for the website images
resource "azurerm_storage_container" "mystoragecontainer" {
  name                  = "website-images"
  storage_account_name  = azurerm_storage_account.webstorageaccount.name
  container_access_type = "container"
}
```

In the above code, I have declared an Azure Storage Account named "falmouthallotmentsweb." The account is associated with the same resource group, location, and tags as the previously created Azure Resource Group for the Falmouth Allotments website.

Additional settings declared are:

- account_tier specifies the performance tier of the storage account as "Standard."

- account_replication_type sets the replication type to "GRS" (Geo-Redundant Storage) for increased data durability.

#### Creating Static Web Apps

To gracefully transition from a broken WordPress site, we are creating two Azure Static Web Apps, a development site and a production site. The existing DNS will be updated to point to the production Static Web App, where visitors will be greeted with a "Website Under Construction" message.

The development site enables the full website solution to be tested before updating the pipeline to push to production.

```terraform
# Development site
resource "azurerm_static_site" "under_construction" {
  name                = "Falmouth-Allotments-Development"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.falmouth_allotments_website.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.falmouth_allotments_website.name
  tags = {
    environment          = "production"
    Falmouth_Allotments  = "website"
  }
}
```

Finally, the terraform code creates the production website. Initially, the under construction website will be hosted here and eventually replaced with the new website.

```terraform
# Production site
resource "azurerm_static_site" "production_website" {
  name                = "Falmouth-Allotments-org"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.falmouth_allotments_website.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.falmouth_allotments_website.name
  tags = {
    environment          = "production"
    Falmouth_Allotments  = "website"
  }
}
```

## Web design

For the web design, I'm using React to meet the requirements of the development project. Initially, I built a single page website as a temporary website: 

![Temporary Website](https://personalblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/websiteimages/falmouth%20allotments%20temp%20page-1.webp)

The temporary website [scores an A+ on carbon emissions](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/falmouthallotments-org/) and a perfect score on [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/#devtools). The Lighthouse score being a lot easier to achieve on a simple one page website. That is not to say it did not require work to achieve. My initial colour schemes for buttons to download the forms, I thought were accessible, only to find the colours were too close that there was the potential that some people may struggle to differentiate text from the background. Fortunately, an error avoided thanks to the accessibility report. 

![100% score](https://personalblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/websiteimages/100ratingfalmouthallotments.webp)

Even with a 100% score, there are still helpful advice to improve performance. For example, it has advised updating the JPEG and PNG files to more a next-gen web image format. For this I have made use of WEBP image files to reduce the performance impact by loading images. The [WEBP Image format](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) has been developed by google and are smaller than JPEG or PNG file formats. The page went from a load time from 0.5 seconds to 0.3 seconds by replacing the PNG and JPEG file formats with WEBP format.

![next-gen web image advisery](https://personalblogimages.blob.core.windows.net/websiteimages/adveriseryfalmouthallotments.webp)

The temporary website does not reflect the new design of the replacement website. It was valuable in testing the aviable accessibility tools as well as the deployment process.

### React setup

Setting up a React project is very easy. There are a large range of React Templates to choose from. However, in this case I went with a [React Basic Template](https://GitHub.com/staticwebdev/react-basic), as I simply needed to build a single page website. By using the template I was able to create a new repository with all the necessary folder structure and files. The only additional file required was the main.yml file for the GitHub Action pipeline for deployment. 

### GitHub Action setup

To deploy the website files to the Azure Static Web App we use GitHub Actions. The pipline builds the website when a new commit is pushed to the `main` branch. 

```yml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```
name: Specifies the name of the GitHub Actions workflow. In this case, it's named "Build and Deploy."

on: Defines the trigger for the workflow. This workflow is triggered on each push to the "main" branch.


```yml
jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

jobs: Describes a set of tasks to be executed as part of the workflow.

build_and_deploy: Specifies the name of the job, which is "build_and_deploy" in this case.

runs-on: Specifies the type of runner for the job. In this example, it runs on an Ubuntu environment.

```yml
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

steps: Defines a series of steps to be executed within the job.

name: Describes the purpose of the step, in this case, checking out the repository.

uses: Specifies the GitHub Actions built-in action to be used. In this case, it's actions/checkout@v2, which checks out the source code repository at the latest commit.

```yml
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 14
```

This step sets up Node.js for the workflow.

name: Describes the purpose of the step, which is to set up Node.js.

uses: Specifies the GitHub Actions built-in action to set up Node.js. In this case, it's actions/setup-node@v3.

with: Provides configuration options for the Node.js setup, such as the version to be used (Node.js version 14).

```yml
      - name: Install Node.js dependencies
        run: npm install
```

This step installs Node.js dependencies using npm.

name: Describes the purpose of the step, which is to install Node.js dependencies.

run: Specifies the command to be run in the shell, which is npm install.

```yml
      - name: Build React app
        run: npm run build
```

This step builds the React app.

name: Describes the purpose of the step, which is to build the React app.

run: Specifies the command to be run in the shell, which is npm run build.

```yml
      - name: Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
        uses: azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
          repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          action: 'upload'
          app_location: 'build'
          output_location: '' 
```

This step deploys the application to Azure Static Web Apps.

name: Describes the purpose of the step, which is to deploy to Azure Static Web Apps.

uses: Specifies the GitHub Actions custom action to deploy to Azure Static Web Apps. In this case, it's azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1.

with: Provides configuration options for the deployment.

azure_static_web_apps_api_token: Specifies the Azure Static Web Apps API token, which is stored as a GitHub secret.

repo_token: Specifies the GitHub token for repository access, which is also stored as a GitHub secret.

action: Specifies the deployment action. In this case, it's set to 'upload' to upload the application.

app_location: Specifies the location of the application files. In this case, it's set to 'build'.

output_location: Specifies the location of the output files. It's an empty string in this case.

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of building a React app, and deploying it to Azure Static Web Apps whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Custom Domain

Azure Static Web Apps provides a domain at set up, in this case [brave-ocean-04472ae03.4.azurestaticapps.net](https://brave-ocean-04472ae03.4.azurestaticapps.net/). Initially, helpful for testing your new app, but if this is a project you want to share then you will look at setting up a custom domain. Fortunately, this is a straight forward process. You need to varify ownership of the domain with Azure and then update records to point at the Azure Static Web App. 

Navigate to the Azure portal and access the Azure Static Web Apps resource. Within the "Custom domains" section, add your desired domain name, ensuring it aligns with your organisation or project. Subsequently, update your domain registrar's DNS settings to point to the Azure-provided DNS values. This facilitates the connection between your custom domain and the deployed Azure Static Web App. Once the DNS configuration propagates, your static website will be accessible through the custom domain. 

## Conclusion

Azure Static Web Apps are a fantastic tool for web development projects. The replacement for the Falmouth Allotment website is an enjoy development project. Coupled with the use of GitHub Actions, the deployment pipeline has been an easy and effective method of quickly deploying the website. During the write up of this blog post I was able to identify an accessibility issue and also update the images to use WEBP format. Each time, a change was made and then pushed to the repo for the automatic deployment to complete in a few minutes. This made updating the deployed website simple.  

Going through the process for the temporary site, meant I have everything set up for the actual replacement site. It has also given me a great opportunity to test the tools to evaluate the site on a simple site, and consider accessibility at the initial development stage rather than trying to resolve issues after the fact. I'm looking forward to deploying the completed replacement site in the near future.
